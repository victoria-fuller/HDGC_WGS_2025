# Structural variant filtering pipeline

Pipeline used to filter output from Manta annotated VCF files to produce a list of candidate structural variants longer than 50 base pairs.

Scripts used:  
1_combine_sv_vcf.sh  
Combines structural VCF files generated by Manta to create a joint VCF file

2_filter_proband.sh  
Filter combined structural VCF file to include only variants present in the proband

3_split_vep_sv.sh  
Split multiple consequences into separate fields

4_filter_af_sv.sh  
Keeps variants that have an allele frequency < 0.01 or missing in gnomAD

5_optional_filter_genes_sv.sh
Filters to keep variants in or near to CDH1 CTNNA1 or genes physically interacting with them

6_both_sibling_sv.sh  
Removes variants with missing genotypes (./.) or homozyogus reference for the proband and both siblings

7_filter_high_moderate_impact_sv.sh
Filters to remove variants that are not high or moderate impact

8_sv_vcf_to_tsv.sh  
Converts the filtered VCF file to a TSV file
