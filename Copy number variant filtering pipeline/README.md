# Copy number variant filtering pipeline

Pipeline used to filter output from Manta annotated VCF files to produce a list of candidate structural variants longer than 50 base pairs.  

1_compress_combine_cnv_vcf.sh  
Combines copy number VCF files generated by cnvkit

2_cnv_filter_proband.sh  
Filters combined copy number VCF file to include only variants present in the proband

3_prepare_bed_annotation.sh  
Prepares a bed file with genes downloaded from Ensembl biomart for annotation of the CNV VCF file

4_cnv_annotate.sh  
Annotates merged CNV VCF file using bed file

5_cnv_filter_genes.sh  
Filters to keep variants in CDH1, CTNNA1 or genes physically interacting with them

6_optional_filter_del.sh  
Filters to keep structural deletions

7_optional_both_sibling_cnv.sh  
Removes variants with missing genotypes (./.) or homozyogus reference for the proband and both siblings

8_cnv_vcf_to_tsv.sh  
Converts the filtered VCF file to a TSV file
